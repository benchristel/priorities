# Priorities

Set this as your homepage in Chrome. When you open a new tab, you'll see a text scratchpad instead of the Google search bar and your most-viewed pages. Whatever you type gets saved offline, so you can use it for notes, a todo list, or whatever else you'd like.

## Try it out!

Just go to [benchristel.github.io/priorities](benchristel.github.io/priorities) to see what it's like.

## Installation (Chrome)

1. Go to [chrome://settings/](chrome://settings/)
2. Under **Appearance**, check the box next to "Show Home button".
3. An option should appear allowing you to change your homepage. Set the URL to [benchristel.github.io/priorities](benchristel.github.io/priorities).
