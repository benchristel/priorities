# Priorities

Priorities is a web browser homepage. (Remember those?!) If one of your New Year's resolutions is to waste less time on the internet, Priorities can help you out.

When you open a new tab, you'll see a text scratchpad instead of the Google search bar and your most-viewed pages. Whatever you type gets saved offline, so you can use it for notes, a todo list, or whatever else you'd like.

Hopefully, this makes it easier to get out of the rut of checking the same old sites over and over again.

## Try it out!

Just go to [benchristel.github.io/priorities](benchristel.github.io/priorities) to see what it's like.

## Installation (Chrome)

1. Install the [New Tab Redirect](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/new-tab-redirect/icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna) extension. (Disclaimer: I didn't make this extension; I just use it. Install at your own risk.)
2. Go to the extension's options page (chrome-extension://icpgjfneehieebagbmdbhnlpiopdcmna/options.html) and change the Redirect URL to `https://benchristel.github.io/priorities/`.
3. Open a new tab to check that it worked :)
